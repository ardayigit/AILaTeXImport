# AILaTeXImport
Import Adobe Illustrator images into LaTeX

In the past I often used [XFig](http://www.xfig.org) to make simple
drawings and include them in LaTeX documents. I particularly admire
XFig's feature to export _combined PDF and LaTeX_ files.

This project contains
 - An .jsx Script that enables Illustrator to do a similar combined export
 - An .sty package to be included in the LaTeX document
