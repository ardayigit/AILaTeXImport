# AILaTeXImport
Import Adobe Illustrator images into LaTeX

In the past I often used [XFig](http://www.xfig.org) to make simple
drawings and include them in LaTeX documents. I particularly loved
XFig's feature to export _combined PDF and LaTeX_ files.

This package contains a .jsx Script that enables Illustrator to do the
same combined export and a .sty package to be included in the LaTeX
document.
