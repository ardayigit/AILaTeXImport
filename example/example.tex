    \title{Pythagorean Theorem}

    The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle where $c$ is
    the the hypotenuse and $a$ and $b$ are the two other sides following
    equation holds:
    \[
        a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \quad .
    \]
    The following images illustrates why Pythagoras' theorem holds:

    Both squares have the same dimension $a+b$ and therefore have the same
    area. Both squares contain four triangles with sides $a,b,c$ (blue).
    The rest of the left square is occupied by a square with area $c^2$; the
    rest of the right square is occupied with two squares with area $a^2$ and
    $b^2$.

    Therefore $c^2$ in the left square and $a^2$ and $b^2$ in the right square
    occupy the same area which proves the theorem.
